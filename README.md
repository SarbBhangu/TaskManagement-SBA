# Reflection

This project was honestly one of the hardest ones I’ve done so far. I ran into issues connecting my JavaScript to my HTML and getting the filters to actually work.

I fixed my issues by using the browser console, testing ideas, and learning how to debug without giving up. It felt really rewarding when I finally got it to work. Small mismatches can throw everything off, but I learned how to stay patient.

If I had more time, I’d focus on cleaning up the layout a bit more and improving the overall look of the app. This time, I was more focused on getting my JavaScript code working correctly.
